<h1>MySql-quiz</h1>
This is a CLI application that does a quiz for the user.

The application will query a localhost MySQL database for the questions and answers to each question and store them in a list.

The application will then choose a random question and present it to the user with the available answers as a multichoice quiz.

The app will tell the user if they got the question correct or not.
